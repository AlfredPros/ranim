# Ranim

Manim-inspired Ren'Py template for presentation and animation. This project was initially made for AlfredPros' VN Conference 2024 talk. This template works by providing customizable
screen components. These components can be combined together for the users' need.

# Usage

It is advised to run this project on Ren'Py `7.4.x` and above.

However, Ren'Py `7.5.2`/`8.0.2` and `7.5.3`/`8.0.3` is not recommended as timer-based screen made in this template would interfere with how button focus works.  

# Contributor Note

You are free to contribute to this project. As you do, please consider the following.

- The contribution help improve the existing components or add a new component that is reasonably helpful.
- Prioritize on using screens with minimal to no Python displayable class for the sake of readability for non-Python programmers.
